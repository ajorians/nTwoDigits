# nTwoDigits
Towers for the TI-NSpire calculator

About:
This is a game for the TI-nSpire!  It works on the TI-NSpire CX CAS with ndless 3.1 and should work on the TI-nspire models.  It is a game where you need to search to find the solution.  In each level you are presented with 9 cells with numbers in them.  You object is to put some of the cells in one group and some of the cells in the other group such that the total of the cells in each group are equal.  In these levels you don't need to select all of the cells.

How to put on calculator:
Start up TI-NSpire Student Software or whatever you use to put it on the calculator.  Then just drag-n-drop the nTwoDigits-sdl.prg.tns file into the application to transfer it to your calculator.  You have to have ndless 3.1 on your calculator in order to run it!

After you run it; you can add and play additional levels.  With ndless it allows start up files; and so you can add more level files to your calculator and play them!

How to play:
Navigate the menu using the arrow keys (or 2/4/6/8 keys) and the Enter key to proceed to the level selection.
Nativate the level selection with the arrow keys (or 2/4/6/8 keys) and the Enter key to proceed with the level.
Use the arrow keys to move the selector around the board
Press the Enter key on a cell to toggle it from in the left group, in the right group, and then back to deselected.
Use the - and + keys to undo and redo your moves.

Extra levels:
This program works with external level files!  There is only a sample level included.  Extra level files which can be placed in any folder on the calculator.  A subfolder is a great place to put them.  When you first ran nTwoDigits-sdl.png.tns it registered the extension 'twodigits' and so because the levels have the extension 'twodigits' at the end it is associated with the nTwoDigits-sdl program.  Let me know if you'd be interested in a level editor or additional levels!  The make-up of a level is rather simple; and so if you take a look at the source and/or the level file you'll probably be able to figure it out.

Source:
I included my source.  I programmed with C.  It uses nSDL as well as the ndless Software Development Kit.
